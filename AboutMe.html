								<p>My journey to becoming a qualified Secondary school teacher.</p>
								<hr />
								<!--<d1>
									<h3><dt>SECONDARY EDUCATION - St. Gregory's College Campbelltown</dt></h3>
										<dd>
											<p>During my time at St. Gregory's College Campbelltown, I had the privilege of immersing myself in a rich and rewarding educational journey. The school provided a nurturing environment where I thrived academically and personally. Mathematics became a source of fascination and joy for me, allowing me to excel and ultimately secure the top position in my grade, achieving a remarkable Band 6 in my HSC. Additionally, I found immense satisfaction in hands-on subjects like timber, design and technology, and construction, where I honed my practical skills and creative thinking. Earning Band 5s in my HSC for my timber and design and technology majors was a testament to my dedication and passion for these subjects. As I reflect on my schooling experience, I can't help but feel a tinge of nostalgia and gratitude. St. Gregory's College was more than an institution—it was a place where I not only acquired knowledge but also fostered a love for learning. The connections I formed with teachers and peers, along with the invaluable lessons I learned, have left an indelible mark on my journey.</p>
										</dd>
									<h3>POST SCHOOL CAREER - Tradesman</h3>
										<dd>
											<p>My journey in the world of trades has been an exhilarating one, defined by growth and transformation. Beginning with my Certificate III in Formwork/Falsework at Lend Lease, Barangaroo, Sydney, I was introduced to the intricacies of construction and the art of precision. This experience paved the way for a broader understanding, leading me to undertake a bridging course for a Certificate III in Carpentry. For five years, I honed my skills as a carpenter, immersing myself in a diverse range of projects, from crafting new homes to revitalising spaces through renovations, and bringing outdoor dreams to life with decking and pergolas. Each project brought new challenges that fostered my problem-solving abilities and deepened my passion for the craft. The decision to transition to a teaching degree was not an end but a new chapter. The lessons I learned through my trade experience, the patience cultivated, and the satisfaction of creating with my hands, all serve as a foundation as I embark on my journey as an educator.</p>
										</dd>
									<h3>UNIVERSITY DEGREE - Australian Catholic University</h3>
										<dd>
											<p>My ongoing university journey at the Australian Catholic University's Strathfield Campus has been a blend of inspiration and growth. Pursuing a unique combination of Bachelor of Arts (Technology) and Bachelor of Education (Secondary) has allowed me to explore the intersection of technology and education, shaping me into a well-rounded and adaptable learner. Throughout my three years, I've embarked on enriching placements at John Therry Catholic College, Magdalene Catholic College, and St Benedict's Catholic College, immersing myself in real classroom experiences. These placements have been invaluable, offering insights into the dynamics of education and allowing me to refine my teaching approach. The fusion of theoretical knowledge with practical application has ignited my passion for teaching, and the supportive environment of ACU has played a crucial role in my academic and personal development. As I navigate this journey, I continue to embrace each opportunity with enthusiasm, cherishing the lessons learned, and looking forward to the contributions I can make in the field of education.</p>
